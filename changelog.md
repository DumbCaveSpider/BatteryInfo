# v1.0.2
- Changed Android implementation, it should work without crashing but it won't work properly (without proper testing)
- Attempted to detect Windows 11 Energy Saver implementation
# v1.0.1
- Due to my lack of Android testing, the Android implementation is untested and will break.
- Removed the Windows Battery Saver implementation. That because Win11 broke it so only works on Win10 for now.
# v1.0.0
- Battery stuff
