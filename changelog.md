# v1.0.3
- Removed Android support entirely until I find a better way to do this.
- Removed the Windows 11 Energy Saver implementation as it doesn't work. (still works on Windows 10)
# v1.0.2
- Changed Android implementation, it should work without crashing but unable to verify without an Android device. :/
- Attempted to detect Windows 11 Energy Saver implementation
# v1.0.1
- Due to my lack of Android testing, the Android implementation is untested and will break.
- Removed the Windows Battery Saver implementation. That because Win11 broke it so only works on Win10 for now.
# v1.0.0
- Battery stuff
